# Graphs

## A library for different graph algorithms in Rust

<!-- I write this mainly for fun and to implement some concept from my computer science studies,
but I'd be pleased to hear any kind of critic, suggestions or help -->
Because project structure wasn't really thought out, I decided to copy the code
from [petgraph](https://crates.io/crates/petgraph) and try to understand the
concepts, reimplementing parts of the code, writing some own algorithm-implementations
and so on.
